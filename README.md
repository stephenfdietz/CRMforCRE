# CRMforCRE - Commercial Real Estate CRM Platform

## Project Overview

**CRMforCRE** is a purpose-built CRM for commercial real estate Asset Managers and Executives. This is a greenfield Next.js prototype that will serve as the frontend foundation for a production SaaS platform.

### Business Context
- **Company**: SaaS business with 150 customers, 1200 buildings currently
- **Strategy**: CRM as entry point to sell additional workflows (HubSpot model)
- **Target Users**: Asset Managers, Executives, Brokers (brokers are first target personas)
- **Scale Requirements**: Must handle large portfolios (1,500+ buildings, thousands of deals)
- **Goal**: Fast MVP to production for important customers

## MVP Requirements

### Core Features (Phase 1 - ‚úÖ COMPLETED)
1. **‚úÖ Opportunity Object** - Central deal tracking entity
2. **‚úÖ Opportunity Record View** - Detail page with editable attributes  
3. **‚úÖ Kanban UI** - 6-stage pipeline management
4. **‚úÖ List UI** - Alternative table view of opportunities
5. **‚úÖ Custom Stage Labels** - Customer display names with system stage tracking
6. **‚úÖ Contacts Integration** - People mapped to opportunities
7. **‚úÖ Calendar Placeholder** - "Coming Soon" page for future development
8. **‚úÖ Real Estate Visuals** - Building imagery, suite info, competitive intelligence
9. **‚úÖ Multi-Space Support** - Handle opportunities across multiple buildings

### Enhanced Features (Phase 2 - ‚úÖ COMPLETED)

- **‚úÖ Competitive Intelligence** - Space reservation warnings and competition tracking
- **‚úÖ OpportunitySpace Junction** - Individual stages per space within opportunity
- **‚úÖ Enhanced Activity Timeline** - Building-specific events and activities

## System Architecture

### 6-Stage Pipeline System
We implemented a sophisticated dual-stage architecture:

**System Stages (Backend - for analytics):**
1. `NEW` - Initial inquiry or lead
2. `QUALIFIED` - Qualified prospect with confirmed needs  
3. `NEGOTIATING` - Active negotiations and proposals
4. `LEASE_DRAFTING` - Legal review and lease documentation
5. `CLOSED_WON` - Deal successfully closed (triggers Lease object creation)
6. `CLOSED_LOST` - Deal lost or abandoned

**Display Names (Frontend - customizable per customer):**
- NEW ‚Üí "Prospect" 
- QUALIFIED ‚Üí "Qualified Lead"
- NEGOTIATING ‚Üí "Hot Pursuit"
- LEASE_DRAFTING ‚Üí "Legal Review"
- CLOSED_WON ‚Üí "Deal Closed"
- CLOSED_LOST ‚Üí "Lost Deal"

**Benefits:**
- Cross-customer analytics (average time NEW ‚Üí CLOSED_WON)
- Flexible customer branding
- Consistent reporting across platform

### Core Data Model

#### Opportunity (Central Entity)
```typescript
{
  id: string
  name: string
  stage: SystemStage // Overall opportunity stage
  company: Company
  opportunitySpaces: OpportunitySpace[] // Junction table
  contacts: Person[]
  totalSF: string
  expectedValue: string
  dates: { targetClose, leaseStart, created, lastActivity }
  notes: string
  attachments: Attachment[]
}
```

#### OpportunitySpace (Junction Table - KEY INNOVATION)
```typescript
{
  id: string
  stage: SystemStage // Individual stage for this space
  reservationStatus: 'available' | 'reserved' | 'competing'
  competingOpportunities: string[] // Other opportunities considering this space
  lastUpdated: string
  stageHistory: StageHistory[]
  building: Building
  spaces: Space[]
  leaseTerms: LeaseTerms
}
```

**Why OpportunitySpace is Critical:**
- Handles multi-location deals (e.g., EcoVolt wanting space in 2 buildings)
- Tracks individual progress per space (Cobblestone at "Qualified", Innovation Tower at "Negotiating")
- Enables competitive intelligence (Suite 1205 being pursued by 3 tenants)
- Supports space reservation logic

#### Supporting Objects
- **Building** - Physical properties with amenities, parking, class
- **Space** - Leasable units within buildings (defined by Space Mapper tool)
- **Person** - Contacts with roles (tenant reps, decision makers, brokers)
- **Company** - Tenant companies, landlords, brokerage firms
- **Activity** - Events, tours, calls, emails tied to opportunities
- **Lease** - Created when opportunity reaches CLOSED_WON (separate lifecycle)

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working (Updated: Dec 2024)
1. **Enhanced Opportunity Detail Page** (`/leasing/opportunities/[id]`)
   - Multi-building display with individual stage management
   - Interactive stage dropdowns that update in real-time
   - Competitive intelligence warnings (yellow alerts for competing spaces)
   - Comprehensive contact management with role identification
   - Building-specific document organization
   - Enhanced activity timeline with building context

2. **6-Column Kanban Board** (`/leasing`)
   - Complete 6-stage system (NEW ‚Üí QUALIFIED ‚Üí NEGOTIATING ‚Üí LEASE_DRAFTING ‚Üí CLOSED_WON/LOST)
   - System stages with customer display names
   - Competition level indicators on cards
   - Multi-space opportunity support with space count badges
   - Proper stage counts and visual hierarchy

3. **Enhanced Table View** 
   - Filterable and searchable interface
   - Competition indicators with colored dots
   - Stage badges using customer display names
   - Currency formatting and contact avatars
   - Direct links to opportunity detail pages

- Mock data structure is solid, but could use more variety in examples
- Need proper error handling for stage change failures
- Stage change animations/transitions not implemented
- No validation for invalid stage transitions yet
- Documentation update script requires manual execution (semi-automated)

### üìÅ Key Files (Updated: Dec 2024)

## Development Notes

### For New Chat Sessions
If starting a new chat session, provide this context:
- "I'm working on CRMforCRE, a commercial real estate CRM prototype"
- "We've implemented a 6-stage system with OpportunitySpace junction table"
- "The MVP includes opportunity detail page, kanban board, table view with interactive stage management"
- "Key innovation is handling multi-location deals with individual stages per space"

### For Engineers
- The frontend demonstrates the complete data model and user interactions
- OpportunitySpace junction table is the key architectural decision
- Stage management system balances customer flexibility with analytics consistency
- Focus on the opportunity detail page - it showcases all the complex relationships

## Business Impact

This prototype validates:
- **Scalability**: Can handle 1,500+ building portfolios  
- **Flexibility**: Supports simple single-space deals and complex multi-location expansions
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Unique feature for landlords to create urgency
- **User Experience**: Asset Manager and Broker-focused interface
- **Technical Foundation**: Solid architecture for rapid feature development
